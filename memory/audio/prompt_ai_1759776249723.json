  "geminiPrompt": "Okay, let's take that solid foundation and inject it with more evocative language, sensory details, and artistic direction.\n\n---\n\nEnhanced Music Prompt:\n\nTITLE SUGGESTION (Optional): \"Ethereal Drift,\" \"Neon Bloom,\" \"Deep Reverie,\" \"Midnight Ascent\"\n\nGENRE & TEMPO: Immerse the listener in a liquid-smooth, yet undeniably driving journey through Liquid Drum & Bass, locked in at a propulsive 174 BPM.\n\nCORE SONIC LANDSCAPE:\n\n   Drums: The rhythmic backbone is forged from crisp, intricately programmed breakbeat drums, featuring skillfully chopped, reverbed, and slightly saturated Amen breaks that provide both vintage texture and modern propulsion. Think shimmering, organic hats and punchy, tight snares that breathe with the groove.\n   Bass: A warm, evolving, and slightly detuned Reese bass provides the primary melodic and harmonic movement, glowing and undulating through the mix. This is complemented by a deep, foundational sub-bass that creates a visceral, chest-rattling pressure without overwhelming the dreaminess.\n   Pads: Expansive, luminous atmos pads swirl and breathe, creating a hazy, ethereal backdrop that stretches into infinite space, evoking a sense of wistful wonder and cosmic calm. They should feel like a nebula of sound.\n   Synth Lead: A melodic, expressive synth lead cuts through the atmosphere, delivering a soaring, memorable hook that feels both optimistic and subtly melancholic. It should have a warm, slightly resonant timbre, hinting at classic synth sounds.\n\nDYNAMIC EFFECTS:\n\n   A heavy, yet musical compressor glues the entire mix together, imparting a cohesive, powerful punch and a feeling of controlled intensity, making every element feel part of a unified whole.\n   Long, lush reverb tails on pads and select rhythmic elements create vast sonic spaces and a deep sense of immersion, allowing sounds to decay beautifully into the atmosphere.\n   Subtle, yet impactful filter sweeps add dynamic movement and build anticipation, particularly on pads and lead elements, suggesting breathing, evolving textures that open and close like a sonic aperture.\n\nVOCAL ELEMENT: A smooth, introspective male vocal, delivered either as whispered, poetic spoken word, or soulful, understated melodic phrases. It should add a human, contemplative layer without dominating the instrumental narrative, perhaps exploring themes of introspection, connection, or discovery.\n\nOVERALL MOOD & ATMOSPHERE: A beautifully paradoxical blend of sensations:\n\n   Warmth & Dreaminess: Achieved through the lush pads, glowing Reese bass, and expansive reverb, inviting the listener into a hazy, introspective reverie.\n   Groovy & Dark: The relentless yet fluid breakbeats provide an irresistible, head-nodding groove, subtly undercurrented by the deep sub-bass and detuned Reese that hint at a profound, melancholy depth and late-night contemplation.\n   Uplifting: Ultimately, the track builds towards a sense of radiant optimism and serene hope, driven by the soaring synth lead and the overall atmospheric expanse, leaving the listener with a feeling of gentle elevation and profound beauty.\n\n---\n\nThis version adds more sensory details (glowing, undulating, nebula, cosmic calm), describes the function of elements beyond just their name, and articulates how the various moods intertwine to create a rich, complex emotional landscape."
